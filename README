VISIT + LIBSIM + NEK5000

So far there are three examples in the src directory.

 # manderbrot file contains example of the simulator which uses libsim in interactive mode. The cmake contains the dependancies. In order to run it be sure to have -dir pointing to the current installed visit binaries.

# mandelbulbsim contains the code to run the simulator in batch mode.

# turboChannel directory is also dependant on the Nek5000 source code. This file needs a patch for Nek5000. TODO: add the patch file for Nek5000 to fix the libsim/visit bug (only related to fortran).
